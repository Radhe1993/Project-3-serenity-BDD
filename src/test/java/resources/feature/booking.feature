Feature: Restful Booker
  As a user I want to test Restful Booker HTTP Operations

  Scenario:  Check End to End CURD operations
    Given  I get all data
    When I send POST request to create a new booking with firstName"<firstName>", lastName"<lastName>", totalprice "<totalprice>", depositpaid "<depositpaid>", checkin "<checkin>", checkout"<checkout>" additionalneeds "<additionalneeds>"
    Then I verify that new booking is created by id
    And I send a Put request with  firstName"<firstName>", lastName"<lastName>", totalprice "<totalprice>", depositpaid "<depositpaid>", checkin "<checkin>", checkout"<checkout>" additionalneeds "<additionalneeds>"
    And The totalprice "<totalprice>" is successfully updated
    And I send delete booking by id
    Then The booking is successfully deleted from the record
